Q1: Why might we consider using Git?
We should use Git because it's a version control system that let's people save continously progress, go back to previous changes at any point, and let's people  make changes on different parts of code without affecting others with branching. Additionally, git is especially useful in collaborative environments as many people can work on any part of the code at one, merge everything together, and compare changes to have 1 consistent version between everyone.
