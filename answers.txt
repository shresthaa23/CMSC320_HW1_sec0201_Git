Q1: Why might we consider using Git?
We should use Git because it's a version control system that let's people save continously progress, go back to previous changes at any point, and let's people  make changes on different parts of code without affecting others with branching. Additionally, git is especially useful in collaborative environments as many people can work on any part of the code at one, merge everything together, and compare changes to have 1 consistent version between everyone. 

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.
Data science can be applied to sports because of all of the data that can be used to better understand the game, the players playstyles and current ability. Like in football, coaches can use data science to figure out if it's better to go for it on fourth down vs punting, they can understand how often opposing teams defenes run man vs zone schemes and they can see how effective current plays are for the team in average yards.
